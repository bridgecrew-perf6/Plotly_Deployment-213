The purpose of the analysis is to create a html site that takes demographic info such as ethnicity, gender and age and belly button bacterial information to create an interactive webpage and show three different bacterial charts.  The charts are a bar chart which illustrates top 10 bacterial cultures, a bubble chart that shows the number of bacteria per sample and lastly a gauge chart to show the frequency of belly button scrubs per week.  On the left side of the screen, you can look up each person using the dropdown menu.
